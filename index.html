<h1>Hello world</h1>

<p>
    Hi vittore, I've added the second script you mentioned right before</body>
tag, however, it doesn't seem to load the CSS within the head section... thoughts? The main problem, is we are creating
a new stylesheet to overwrite the the stylesheet that the CMS forces us to use. So we created a NEW stylesheet to
overwrite their settings. We woud like it to load RIGHT after they load theirs... otherwise, their stylesheet loads, and
shows the site, and then a few seconds later, our changes show up... – Rahil Pirani Aug 6 '12 at 19:39
